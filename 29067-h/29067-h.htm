<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p>This lesson-book was prepared in order to meet a need realized in my
own work as a pastor; a need which is felt by many pastors and workers
among the young.</p>

<p>In the Home, Sunday-School and Church are children of all ages,
from six to sixteen. It is found impracticable to give to all this varied
company the same teaching. The lessons that are admirably adapted
for boys and girls between ten and fifteen are utterly unsuited to the
children between six and ten. Moreover after looking carefully, I have
not been able to find satisfactory lessons which can be taught to the
young children except by one especially trained for the work; and such
instructions are hard to find.</p>

<p>After various experiments I adopted in my own teaching the following
plan. We divided the children into two sections; the First Section including
all over nine years old, the Second Section all those under nine.</p>

<p>I selected for twelve lessons, twelve Bible stories following in succession,
beginning with the story of Adam and Eve. On each of these
stories I prepared a catechism of very simple questions and answers, and
printed them by a duplicating process. After the opening of "The Children's
Hour," I told the story to all present in simple language, explaining
that while the story was told to all it was for the special benefit of the
smaller children; but <b>I noticed even the oldest boys and girls listened to
it with interest equal to the youngest</b>.</p>

<p>After the Bible story and the singing of a hymn, the Second Section
withdrew to another room. There the children were divided into classes,
and taught the questions and answers. A copy of the leaflet containing
the questions and answers of the story for the day was given to each child,
to be taken home and reviewed by parents or the older members of the
family.</p>

<p>By separating the children into two grades, the older young people
can receive instruction suited to their age, and the little ones are also
provided for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="images/4.png">4</a>]</span></p>

<p>So many pastors and others have requested copies of the leaflets
containing the questions and answers, that it has seemed desirable to
publish them; and they are now completed upon the entire Bible story,
and brought together in book form for the use of teachers of children.</p>

<p>These lessons may be used in classes of the Sunday School, by teachers
who desire a more consecutive treatment of the Bible story than is given
in the International Sunday School lessons, and by parents.</p>

<p>There are many families where "The Story of the Bible" has been
read to the interest and profit of the children. Parents will find that these
lessons will help to fix the important facts of the Bible story in the minds
of the little ones.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the questions and answers do not embrace all
the stories in the book. A selection has been made of what seem to be the
most important subjects, affording weekly lessons for one year, with
allowance for vacations, in the Old Testament, and another year in the
New Testament.</p>

<p>In the hope that these lessons may aid the children of to-day, who
are to be the men and women of to-morrow, to gain a definite knowledge
of the Word of God these lessons are sent forth.</p>

<h2><a name="SUGGESTIONS_FOR_TEACHING" id="SUGGESTIONS_FOR_TEACHING"></a>SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING.</h2>

<p>1. Let the teacher in advance read over the questions and answers
of the lesson, note their relation to the story as told in "The Story of the
Bible," and to some extent fit the story to the lesson which is to be taught.</p>

<p>2. Tell the story (or stories) of the day's lesson to the children, following
the plan given in the book. Use very simple words and avoid all
that are in any sense technical, or above the mind of a child.</p>

<p>3. After telling the story for the day, the children may be divided
into classes, and assistants may teach the questions and answers. But
before the close of the session it would be well to ask all the questions,
and have the answers given by the children.</p>

<p>4. In order to complete each course, in the Old Testament and in the
New, within a year, it may be necessary to omit some of the lessons,
where classes take a vacation in the summer. To complete the course
of each year in such classes the Reviews at the end of each series of lessons
might be omitted, although they will be valuable as summaries of
the important facts of the lesson. Some teachers might prefer to omit
from the Old Testament lessons, some of the following in order to complete
the course in a year. Lesson XXVIII David and Absalom; XXX
The Temple; XXXVI Elisha and Jonah; XXXVIII, XXXIX The
Kings of Judah; XLIV Queen Esther. These are suggested for omission
not because they are unimportant or uninteresting, but in case some
lessons must be omitted. In order to complete the course in one year
in the New Testament lessons, the following might be omitted, if some
must be. XVI The Mothers Prayer; XX The Good Shepherd; XXIII
Jesus and the Children; XXVI, XXVII The Last Teachings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="images/6.png">6</a>]</span></p>

<h3><br />Lesson I. The Beautiful Garden.</h3>

<div class='center'><b>(Tell Story 1 in "Hurlbut's Story of the Bible.")</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>To the Teacher:</b></div>

<p>Under the title of each lesson throughout these pages will be seen
instructions to tell certain lessons, with numbers. These numbered
lessons and parts correspond with the numbered lessons and parts in
"Hurlbut's Story of the Bible."</p>

<p>Let the teacher begin by asking, "Who can tell us what is the first
verse of the Bible?" When hands are raised, call on three or four
children to repeat the verse in turn; then let all the class repeat it in
concert. Explain what the verse means, that God made the world, and
all the things in it. Tell the story of the creation of the world; of the
first man and the first woman; the Garden of &#274;&acute;d&#277;n, and how &#258;d&acute;&#259;m and
&#274;ve lost their home, and were driven out. Then teach the class the
answers to the following questions. At the close of the lesson, see that
every young pupil is shown just where the questions and answers on the
lesson are found. The answers should be reviewed by parents, or older
brothers and sisters, until the child can repeat them thoroughly, and can
tell in his own language, the story of the lesson.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Questions and Answers.</b></div>

<p><b>1.</b> What is the first verse in the Bible? <b>"In the beginning God created

<h3><br />Lesson II. The Earliest People.</h3>

<div class='center'><b>(Tell Stories 2 and 3.)</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>To the Teacher:</b></div>

<p>1. In the story of C&#257;in and &#256;&acute;b&#277;l, explain carefully what is meant by
"an altar"; and how in early times people came to God in prayer. With
little children, use the word "praying," rather than "worship," and
"gift to God" or "offering," rather than "sacrifice."</p>

<p>2. In the story of "The Great Ship," explain what "an ark" was,
properly a chest or box; in this story, a great ship, built not to sail fast,
but to float on the water, and to hold a great amount. Perhaps it was
made so large, not only to carry many animals and their food, but also
very many people, if the people had been willing to be saved by it.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> What wicked thing did C&#257;in do when the two boys grew up to be
men? <b>He killed his brother &#256;&acute;b&#277;l.</b></p>

<p><b>4.</b> What does the Bible tell of the earliest people who were on the
earth? <b>They lived to be hundreds of years old.</b></p>

<p><b>5.</b> Who lived the longest of any of those people? <b>Me&#781;&#772;-thu&#804;&acute;se-lah, who
lived more than nine hundred years.</b></p>

<p><b>6.</b> Were those who lived at that time good people? <b>Nearly all of them
were very wicked.</b></p>

<p><b>7.</b> What good man lived in those times? <b>&#274;&acute;n&#335;ch, who walked with
God.</b></p>

<p><b>8.</b> What was the end of &#274;&acute;n&#335;ch's life? <b>He did not die, but God took
him to himself.</b></p>

<p><b>9.</b> What came upon the earth on account of the wickedness of its people?
<b>A great flood.</b></p>

<p><b>10.</b> What good man with his family was saved from the flood? <b>N&#333;&acute;ah
who built the Ark.</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="images/8.png">8</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>11.</b> On what mountain did N&#333;&acute;ah and his family leave the ark after the

<b>B&#257;&acute;bel, afterward called B&#259;b&acute;y&#774;-lon.</b></p>

interested at the outset. Then, the teacher should tell the story from
"Hurlbut's Story of the Bible," explaining how God sent his Angel G&#257;&acute;br&#301;-el
to Z&#259;ch-a-r&#299;&acute;as, the old priest in the temple, to tell him that his wife
E&#781;&#772;-l&#301;s&#797;&acute;a-b&#277;th should have a son, and that the name of the son should be
J&#335;hn. Explain that J&#335;hn was to be sent into the world to prepare people

her that she was to have a son who was to be called J&#275;&acute;s&#797;us. Then teach
the class the answers to the following questions on the subject of this
lesson, and explain to the little pupils just where to find the answers
to the questions of the first lesson, and have them answer the questions

<h3><br />Lesson II. The Stable and Shepherds.</h3>

after receiving an answer ask What place J&#333;&acute;s&#797;eph and M&#257;&acute;ry&#774; went to and
where M&#257;&acute;ry&#774;'s child was born? After the answers have been given, tell
